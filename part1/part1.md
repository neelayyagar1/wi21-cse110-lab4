# Part 1

1. We will output 3 on the console, because var allows us to use the variable even though it is declared in the for loop, it is still within the scope (global variable)

2. We will output 150 on the console, because var allows us to use the variable even though it is declared in the for loop, it is still within the scope (global variable)

3. We will output 150 on the console, because var allows us to use the variable since it is still within the scope (global variable)

4. The function will return the discounted array: [150, 150, 150]. Discounted is declared within the scope

5. 'i' is out of scope, the variable i was declared inside the for loop so it is in a different block. An error will be thrown.

6. 'discountedPrice' is out of scope, the variable discountedPrice was declared inside the for loop so it is in a different block. An error will be thrown.

7. The final price of the product will be outputted to the web console (50 for 100, 100 for 200, and 150 for 300), the finalPrice variable is declared before this line so it is valid and we get these values. 

8. The function will return the discounted array: [50, 100, 150]. Discounted is declared before this thus it is in the same scope and we get this array.
