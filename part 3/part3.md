## DevTools - Debugging

The original function concatenated the two inputs instead of adding them because the input are not ints. Once I added a parseInt() for both values, we get the actual integers that we want to add, and then the + sign in the return statement will become an addition since we are now working with ints. The screenshot of my solution is added in this part3 directory.
